Pair Programming
----------------
Overview
--------
This prac is to summarize the experience of using pair programming to develop a date and time parsing program
using any programming language of our choice “java is our preferred choice”, two persons are involved in this task,
one person plays developer role (alru0011), and the other one plays navigator role (almo0045),
developer writes the program code, while the navigator is setting beside him to review and give instructions about which
direction to take, and to correct developer if a clear problem with code is observed.

Benefits of pair programming methodology
----------------------------------------
-	Second eye makes it more efficient to catch naive errors like typo error or known programming mistakes like 
forgetting semi colon or a close bracket.
-	Team work style motivates team members.
-	When more than one person works on a problem, cooperation leads to new ideas and code enhancements.
-	Over all accuracy is increased when using pair programming to develop a program or routine.

Difficulties that are experienced with pair programming approach
----------------------------------------------------------------
-	When navigator interrupts developer it was hard for developer to keep track of what he was doing 
and continues working on the current task, it was really time consuming.
-	Overall productivity is low, as in fact there are two “resources” that are working on the same task, 
especially this task duration was relatively small “only 2 hours”, so that there was more than 30 minutes wasted in negotiations,
arguments, and interruptions.
-	When there is missing harmony between developer and negotiator, 
a lot of time and effort is spent on distractions and interruptions.

What would I change next time
-----------------------------
-	Choose my coworker with same background and knowledge with similar skill set.
-	Select my coworker to provide maximum harmony to get best results and productivity and
to minimize arguments between developer and negotiator.
-	Pair programming is good approach when task has relatively enough time, 
so I think that such tow or three hours tasks are not applicable for pair programming.

Conclusion
----------
Pair programming methodology is like any other software development methodologies;
it has its own benefits and also has its own difficulties, this research is not about judging pair programming 
and figure out if it is good or it is bad, it is about knowing its advantages and disadvantages to be able to take
the decision of using it or not. According to task in hand, and depending to many factors pair programming can be used or not,
factors like task time line, task complexity, and available cost may affect the decision of using pair programming. 
From my small experience with pair programming “which is only 2 hours as it was my first time to work using this approach” 
I think that I will use it in the future when the circumstances allows me to do so. Also I believe that this research will
help me a lot to take such decision.
